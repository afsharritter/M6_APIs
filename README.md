# M6_WeatherPy_APIs
Module 6 Challenge:

This challenge used OpenWeatherMap API and a GoogleMaps API to add weather data to the PlanMyTrip app. 

## Deliverable 1

For this deliverable, OpenWeatherMap data was retrieved for 717 cities, using the Citipy library and a list of 2000 random coordinates. For each city, the maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and current weather description were collected. 

## Deliverable 2

For this deliverable, input statements were used to produce a list of possible travel destinations based on customers' maximum temperature preferences. We then used Google Maps Places API to find hotels in those locations, and plot them on an interactive map. 

## Deliverable 3

For this deliverable, Google Directions API was used to plot driving directions between four cities in Nigeria.
